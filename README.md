Farmer Guider 🌾
Farmer Guider is a machine learning-based system designed to assist farmers in determining the most suitable crop plantation based on environmental factors. By leveraging historical data, the model predicts optimal crops based on real-time variables such as temperature, humidity, nitrogen, phosphorus, and other soil and environmental properties.
Features 🚜
Prediction of Suitable Crops: Based on historical data and current environmental factors.
Input Variables:
Temperature
Humidity
Nitrogen
Phosphorus
pH Levels
Other soil and environmental conditions
Crop Recommendations: The system predicts which crops are best suited for planting in the current environmental conditions, helping farmers make data-driven decisions.
Installation 🛠️
Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https: https://github.com/Raghav15-01/Farmer-Guide-/new/main
Navigate to the directory
bash
Copy code
cd farmer-guider
Install dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed. You can install the dependencies using:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage 🌱
Prepare your input data:
The model takes in inputs such as temperature, humidity, nitrogen, phosphorus, and soil pH. Ensure the data is properly preprocessed before feeding into the model.
Run the model:
You can run the prediction model by executing the following command:
bash
Copy code
python crop_predictor.py --input data/input_file.csv
View the recommendations:
The system will output a list of recommended crops suitable for the input conditions.
Dataset 📊
The model has been trained on historical crop data from various regions, including factors like soil composition, weather conditions, and crop yields. You can use your own dataset for prediction by formatting it accordingly to match the expected input features.
Model Training 🧠
The machine learning model was trained using:
Algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression
Training data: Historical agricultural data with labeled crop types
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, and Recall were used to assess the model's performance.
